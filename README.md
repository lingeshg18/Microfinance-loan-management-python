Security Notes & Best Practices
Hash and salt passwords using bcrypt (do not store plaintext).

Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid SQL injection.

Use a connection pool for scalability.

Secure config files (do not commit credentials to public repos).

Consider adding role-based permission checks in business logic (not just UI).
